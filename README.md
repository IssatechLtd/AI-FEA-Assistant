# AI-FEA-Assistant  
🚀 **AI-Powered FEA Tool for Engineers & Makers**  
A smart, open-source Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tool that simplifies engineering simulations with AI assistance.  

## 🌟 Features  
✅ AI-assisted FEA setup (no complex manual settings!)  
✅ Supports open-source solvers (FEniCS, Code_Aster, CalculiX)  
✅ Works with CAD files (STEP, STL, IGES)  
✅ Cloud-based for easy access (No expensive software needed!)  

## 📌 Roadmap  
🔹 **Phase 1:** Automate FEA with Python scripts  
🔹 **Phase 2:** Add AI-driven interpretation of results  
🔹 **Phase 3:** Build a user-friendly web interface  

## 👥 Looking for Collaborators!  
We need:  
- Python & AI developers  
- Engineers with FEA experience  
- UI/UX designers
