🚀 AI-Powered FEA Tool for Engineers & Makers

🔍 About the Project

AI-FEA-Assistant is an open-source tool that simplifies Finite Element Analysis (FEA) by integrating AI-powered automation. It helps users:

Set up simulations without complex manual inputs

Interpret FEA results more easily

Automate workflows for CAD & simulation software


We aim to lower the learning curve and make FEA more accessible to makers, engineers, and small businesses.

🌟 Features (Planned)

✔️ AI-assisted FEA setup (no complex manual settings!)
✔️ Supports open-source solvers (FEniCS, Code_Aster, CalculiX)
✔️ Works with CAD files (STEP, STL, IGES)
✔️ AI-powered result interpretation (get insights, not just numbers!)
✔️ Future: Standalone solver (reduce dependency on expensive software)

📌 Vision

We want to make FEA as simple as asking ChatGPT a question. Instead of manually setting up simulations, engineers can type what they need, and AI will automate the process—from material selection to boundary conditions and result interpretation.
